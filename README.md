# Introduction and Outline
I volunteer for The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), and am using this project to suggest data visualization opportunities for the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" section of the organization's website. Currently, the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" section is bullets of text with no visualization at all. The statistics are unfortunate and important to know but not easily digestible in their current format. 

The project structure will tell the story of awareness, scope and severity, and support/resources: 
Element 1 - Awareness. Eating disorders affect everybody in some way, and are becoming more prevelent and evasive. Habits such as obsessive comparison of your body to others on social media, weight shaming, "clean" eating, and compulsive exercise can also be classified as eating disorders. Awareness of the different types of eating disorders and growing classifications will be important to capture people's attention.
Element 2 - Scope and Severity. When most people think of someone with an eating disorder, they immediately think of a skinny popular pre-teen who does not eat carbs (think of the movie "Mean Girls"). However, the scope is much broader. Disordered eating and body image can occur through disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, ARFID, binge eating, weight shaming/bullying, compulsive exercise and "clean" eating, diabulimia, and more. With more support and available resources, reports from minority groups including LGBTQ+ and people of color, are gradually increasing. It'll be important to show visualizations of the impact, scope, and severity of eating disorders. 
Element 3 - Resources are Available. It is difficult to have an eating disorder yourself or know someone who does and you do not know how to help. Although eating disorders are becoming more prevelent and evasive, there are resources available to everyone: those struggling, those who want to learn more or support someone who is struggling, or emergency resources and referrals to clinics if needed. I want to end my story on a positive note, as conversations about eating disorders can be difficult to hear - especially for those struggling themselves. 

My expectation is to present the final project using Shorthand. Any visualization platform will be an improvement over the existing block of text, and Shorthand will serve its purpose well for my project. Additionally, having the visualization on a public page will ensure I can get feedback from other volunteers from NEDA and we could potentially link the site directly to the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" page. 

#The Data
The "Statistics & Research on Eating Disoders" website is publically accessible and can be found here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics-research-eating-disorders. As you can see, the current state is informative yet not easily digestible as a full page of bullets and citations. 
Using Shorthand, I hope to take these data points and use visualization to create a story and more engaging website. I want to be inclusive and use all available data, which may be tricky, but it is important to ensure there is consumable data for everyone who visits this website.
