# Part I: 
# Introduction and Outline

I volunteer for The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), and am using this project to suggest data visualization opportunities for the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" section of the organization's website. Currently, the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" section is bullets of text with no visualization at all. The statistics are unfortunate and important to know but not easily digestible in their current format. I am redesigning a real example that I hope to use and implement. Naturally I will have a few more challenges and hurdles to overcome than other students who are just completing this assignment for a grade and will work through them one at a time. 

The project structure will tell the story of awareness, scope and severity, and support/resources: 
Element 1 - Awareness. Eating disorders affect everybody in some way, and are becoming more prevelent and evasive. Habits such as obsessive comparison of your body to others on social media, weight shaming, "clean" eating, and compulsive exercise can also be classified as eating disorders. Awareness of the different types of eating disorders and growing classifications will be important to capture people's attention.
Element 2 - Scope and Severity. When most people think of someone with an eating disorder, they immediately think of a skinny popular pre-teen who does not eat carbs (think of the movie "Mean Girls"). However, the scope is much broader. Disordered eating and body image can occur through disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, ARFID, binge eating, weight shaming/bullying, compulsive exercise and "clean" eating, diabulimia, and more. With more support and available resources, reports from minority groups including LGBTQ+ and people of color, are gradually increasing. It'll be important to show visualizations of the impact, scope, and severity of eating disorders. 
Element 3 - Resources are Available. It is difficult to have an eating disorder yourself or know someone who does and you do not know how to help. Although eating disorders are becoming more prevelent and evasive, there are resources available to everyone: those struggling, those who want to learn more or support someone who is struggling, or emergency resources and referrals to clinics if needed. I want to end my story on a positive note, as conversations about eating disorders can be difficult to hear - especially for those struggling themselves. 

My expectation is to present the final project using Shorthand. Any visualization platform will be an improvement over the existing block of text, and Shorthand will serve its purpose well for my project. Additionally, having the visualization on a public page will ensure I can get feedback from other volunteers from NEDA and we could potentially link the site directly to the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" page. 

# The Data

The "Statistics & Research on Eating Disoders" website is publically accessible and can be found here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics-research-eating-disorders. As you can see, the current state is informative yet not easily digestible as a full page of bullets and citations. My expectation is to use the data to tell a more compelling story of the different types of eating disorders and provide information at a glance. My main focus is to show the different classifications and display the impacts, particularly to the students in this class because our age demographic is statistically greatly impacted by eating disorders - especially due to stress, social media, and intense comparison/competition the CMU culture has. 
Using Shorthand, I hope to take these data points and use visualization to create a story and more engaging website. I want to be inclusive and use all available data, which may be tricky, but it is important to ensure there is consumable data for everyone who visits this website. My biggest concern is making sure all of the data can fit and flow and isn't too much without leaving anything out. Based on the feedback I receive from interviews, I may decide to visualize one topic for the sake of this project and expand from there.

# User Research and Interviews

Target Audience: My target audience is for anyone who visits the site looking for more information on eating disorders. I understand this scope is large but it's something I cannot narrow down or purposefully exclude certain data sets in the final product. I recognize this will be a challenge compared to other projects that have a more singular scope. For this project, I will focus on the contributing factor of bullying and weight shaming instead of the entire website. 
Individual Represenatives: I interviewed a classmate, my sister, and fiance for this project. The classmate I spoke with has never had an eating disorder and was strictly looking at understanding the visualization. My sister actively struggles with disordered eating so was looking at it from a personal lens. My fiance designs logos and websites so has a very keen eye on how to improve accessibility and appeal. Combined, I felt these 3 individuals would provide valuable input. Additionally, NEDA has received feedback from users that this webpage is informative yet too much information in an unappealing way (many admitted they got half-way through the page and stopped reading). 

Interview Script: 
1) What is your experience with eating disorders?
2) Have you heard of the National Eating Disorders Association?
3) Are you familiar or aware of any eating disorder statisics or data?
4) Looking at the existing "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" website, what do you like about it? What do you dislike about it?
5) How do you feel this website could be improved?
6) Look at the storyboard I created. Do you think this would be an improvement to the existing site? What could be improved or changed to make it better? 

# Major Findings from Interviews and Proposed Changes to Sketches, Storyboards, and Wireframes: 
1) Scope. All agreed there was too much information on the "Statistics & Research on Eating Disorders" website. The biggest concern from all was how I was going to effectively visualize all of it in one screen. Everyone suggested a par down the scope for this project. When I asked for suggestions, everyone suggested a different topic (anorexia, athletes and eating disorders, children/teenagers). I suggested bullying and weight shaming because it is the largest contributing factor to eating disorders and is likely the most relatable topic for a bigger audience. Everyone agreed and admitted they have participated in this activity in one way or another.
2) NEDA branding. My initial sketches were done with a wave of my colored pencils set. I was not thinking about a color theme or NEDA branding but need to be. My final sketches will be closer to the calming schema of blue, green, and orange. 
3) Captivating Images. I received suggestions on having triggering images to reinforce the feeling of shame one should feel when they are bullied about their weight. However, NEDA is a support website and does not condone triggering its users with that type of imagery. All images need to be both on brand (point 2) and show support for those experiencing bullying themselves or know someone who is struggling. Likely, a person visiting the site is looking for a help; they are not the bully themselves. 
4) Branching. Because bullying/weight shaming is the biggest contributor to eating disorders, feedback suggests this is the first topic and then branch out from there. For example, in the graphc about overweight girls and boys, have hyperlinks to other visualizations about binge eating and other subtopics of eating disorders. This will also help manage having all of these visualizations on one page. 
5) Visualizations. Overall, the visualizations themselves did not receive much negative feedback. After seeing the starting point of the website, anything is a vast improvement! Notably were focus of the brand and flow: starting from with the overarching theme (which is now bullying/weight shaming) and then having subtopics such as stigma, losing weight, gaining weight, and long-term impacts last.  

# Part II

# The Idea
After receiving positive feedback from Part I, I did not change my project scope and went forward as planned. For the script of my presentation, I wanted to ensure I highlighted my purpose and involvement with NEDA and then let the data visualizations speak for themselves. The presentation structure focuses on weight shaming and the impacts it has on a younger generation and how it follows into adulthood. Then, most importantly, close out with a strong message that "WORDS HAVE POWER" and resources are available for both those struggling and loved ones of those who are struggling.

To best capture the flow, I used Shorthand as the medium for the project. Admittedly I am not very creative or naturally visual (which is why I took this class and improved!) so was beyond grateful for templates. 

Because NEDA already has a statistics and research website, I collected my data from there given my purpose is to show the website is in desparate need of a data visualization facelift. I made sure to cite the one photo I used and an external source to confirm my opening statement. Onto the final chapter . . .
    
# Final Data Story

Although eating disorders impact a large population in one way or another, I wanted to focus on a topic that everyone is familiar with: weight shaming and bullying body. NEDA has seen an increase in requests for resources since COVID-19 forced a national shutdown in the US. Generally, it's because more people are home scrolling through social media and can't go to the gym. Articles and memes about weight gain are everywhere, and it has turned into a joke. Unfortunately it is not funny for those who have an eating disorder and are struggling with both the anxiety of their disordered eating but the pandemic and other ways it will impact their lives. NEDA is a support organization, so I want my message to be informative yet positive and empowering. 

If I could do this project over again, I would make a few adjustments:
1) Visually, in my Shorthand presentation, I regret not using more pictures. However, I did not want to risk any copyright infringements and figure the focus should be on my own data visualizations. 
2) Spend more time learning the ins and outs of Shorthand. I struggled with several things like images and placement but did the best I could in the time we had. Shorthand is a very cool tool that I hope I can use in the future for this project and other work- and volunteer-related projects.

# Post-Presentation Thoughts

Despite my internet crawling and not keeping up with my scrolling speed, I was grateful to share statistics and resources of NEDA with the class. I am hopeful classmates will go to the Google Doc page and take the time to look at my page and learn more. 

# Closing Notes
I learned a lot about data visualization during this class and see graphs and representations in a different light. I also learned how important simplicity and order is, and have taken that lesson to heart in other areas outside of data visualization - including how to write an email and share information with others. Thank you for the opportunity to learn more about telling stories with data!
